# Hashtags Virality in Networked Regional War

This is the code repository for the Group 17's project in the course `CSIT6000K: Social Networks and Social Computing`.

Files in this repository are:

### data_cleaning.ipynb

This notebook performs data pre-processing, obtains basic characteristics of the dataset, and provides processed data for further analysis in R and visualization with Gephi. It is tested under Python 3.9, and requires the following python packages: `pandas, networkx, matplotlib, pyyaml`.

Without modification, this notebook will read from a pre-processed dataset file `out_full.csv`. [Download `out_full.csv` here.](https://mchobby-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/admin_mchobby_io/EmSUE34k3hNBm38I9zBy-hkB5y4l6wtZVWRJRQWC71xDWA?e=kv0Acj)

If you want to use the original dataset (out_1~19.csv), follow the instructions in the first code block of the notebook.

### ergm.R

This script performs ERGM analysis using the data provided by `data_cleaning.ipynb`. You could execute this R script without executing `data_cleaning.ipynb` first, since the required data is already in this repository.

This R script requires the following packages: `igraph, statnet, intergraph`.

### Other files

Most of the remaining files could be generated by running the two scripts above.
